### Introduction & Project Goals ###  
This project`s goal is to help the site owners - the founders of Wingmans, to achieve their goal of inspiring others with their passion for home brew, and maybe along the way make some new acquaintances.    
    
    Note; the review section is fictional as this is a new approach for The Wingmans.  
    It needed to be included as part of the assessment criteria. 
    But is highly relevant as it wil be updated with real reviews in the future.

## UX ##

### User Stories ###  
* As a user I want to see a nice and inspiring website who makes me want to learn more about home brew  
* As a user I want to know the founders vision  
* As a user I want to see pictures of the founders and the home brew in action  
* As a user I want to read reviews from others who have had contact with the founders  
* As a user I want the ability to contact the founders for questions and guidance, and I also want the ability to let them contact me by leaving my e-mail address.

### Development planes ###  

In order to create a website that fulfilled the expectations as described above, I worked closely with the founders throughout the process.  

### Strategy ###  
  
Divided into two categories, the website will focus on the following target audiences:  
  
  * ### Demographic: ###  
    
    * 25 - 55 year olds  
    * Particularly interested in homebrew  

  * ### Psychographics: ###  
    
    * Personality & Attitudes:  
      * Quality conscious  
      * Social  

    * ### Values: ###  

      * Appreciates new acquaintances  
      * You only live once  
    
    * ### Lifestyles: ###  
     
      * Beer lovers  

### User Goals ###  
* Find inspiration for home brew  
* Images of home brew, the process, different beer types and equipment  
* Links to other social media for further inspiration  
* Ability to contact Wingmans directly by phone or email  
* Ability to get the **steps for success** directly from Wingmans by entering an e-mail address in the contact page and push _Start brewing with Wingman`s!_    

### Site Owner Goals ###  
* Inspire others with their work and passion for home brew  
* Help others get started with home brew
* Establish contact with others who share their passion  

### User Requirements And Expectations ###   

* Content that is visually appealing and well structured
* Easy to navigate the website using the navbar  
* Easy to read typography
* Operational links to other pages that open in a new tab  
* Operational contact form for e-mail address input  
* The website is quick to load  

### Design ### 
The design of this website has been created based on the logo of Wingmans and the personality of the founders.  
  
  As the site is ment to be an inspiration-page, but not with to much content as the founders also want to establish contact with others who may have, or in the future might get, the same passion; it was importent to keep the site simple and clean.  

  Index page - contains only the navbar and footer who is the same at all pages, in addition to the logo. The Wingmans logo are used on all their beer labels and i think its a good first impression to the site.   
  
  About page - an evocative image at the top with a following introduction where you get an insight to the founders vision, and also what they look like. Then a review section at the end, where others share there experiance on how the collaboration with The Wingmans has been.  
    
  Gallery page - representative images of Wingman's in action, process and equipment. Here you can get to know them a little bit more, by looking at non-styled real images taken by the founders them self.   
  
  Contact page - contains a contact form where you can contact the founders by typing your your email in the input field. There is also a possibility to write them something if you wish. The background has an exclusive wallpaper to break a little from the other pages, and to create an evocative user.
