### Introduction & Project Goals ###  

Who is The Wingmans? The Wingmans are two middle-aged men who just loves beer! So they made it their hobby. They love to discover new tastes, recreate them or make a brand new. They also love to meet new people and are often spotted in the local bar - with a beer.

This project`s goal is to help the site owners - the founders of Wingmans, to achieve their goal of inspiring others with their passion for home brew, and maybe along the way make some new acquaintances.  

This is the first of four Milestone Projects that I (the developer) must complete during my Full Stack Web Development Program at The Code Institute, and IÂ´m very grateful for The Wingmans trust in me for makeing their first website. 

The main requirements in this project is to make a responsive and static website with a minimum of three pages, using primarily HTML5 and CSS3.
    
    Note; the review section is fictional as this is a new approach for The Wingmans.  
    It needed to be included as part of the assessment criteria. 
    But is highly relevant as it will be updated with real reviews in the future.

### Skelton ###  
  
Wireframes are made in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/). This was a really nice program to check out different styles and how the final result would look like on different screensizes.

### Design ### 
The design of this website has been created based on the logo of Wingmans and the personality of the founders.  
  
  As the site is ment to be an inspiration-page, but not with to much content as the founders also want to establish contact with others who may have, or in the future might get, the same passion; it was importent to keep the site simple and clean.  

  Index page - contains only the navbar and footer who is the same at all pages, in addition to the logo. The Wingmans logo are used on all their beer labels and i think its a good first impression to the site.   
  
  About page - an evocative image at the top with a following introduction where you get an insight to the founders vision, and also what they look like. Then a review section at the end, where others share there experiance on how the collaboration with The Wingmans has been.  
    
  Gallery page - representative images of Wingman's in action, process and equipment. Here you can get to know them a little bit more, by looking at non-styled real images taken by the founders them self.   
  
  Contact page - contains a contact form where you can contact the founders by typing your your email in the input field. There is also a possibility to write them something if you wish. The background has an exclusive wallpaper to break a little from the other pages, and to create an evocative user.

* Fonts  
  [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans): Open Sans, sans-serif.

* Icons  
[Fontawsome](https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery&p=2) provided the icons for [Facebook](https://fontawesome.com/icons/facebook-square?style=brands), [Instagram](https://fontawesome.com/icons/instagram-square?style=brands) and [Snapchat](https://fontawesome.com/icons/snapchat-square?style=brands) + [Hand point](https://fontawesome.com/icons/hand-point-right?style=solid) on founders page.

* Colours  
All the colours were taken from the logo to ensure a harmonious expression.  
  
  * Contact bg/text: Jet 383737 / Black 000000
  * Navigation/footer: Ochre C7782B  
  * Background: Banana Mania FFEBB9

### Features ###  

Each page of the website features a consistent responsive navigational system:  

The Header contains the name of The Wingmans at the left, and the navbar at the right on large screen sizes. When down to medium or less, the navbar collapses but the name remains at the left. The Footer fills one line on large screens, but stack on top of each other on medium or less screen size. 

Features that have been implemented:  
* Easy to navigate on all screensizes.  
* Social media links for more inspiration and more knowledge of who the founders is.
* Link to [Taplist](https://taplist.io/) On Taplist you can watch real-time what beer the Wingmans have on their tap, and how much! Up for a taste? 
* Contact form with submit button. Here you can get the steps for success, ask questions, or just say hello.  
* About Us page where you get to know the vision of the founders.  
* Reviews Section where you can get an impression of how it is to collaborate and speak with the founders.

Features that will be implemented in the future:  
* Video blog / link to youtube  
* Logbook  
* Forum  
* Background music / button on-off

### Testing ###  
The testing process for me has been through the intire building of this project, as I wanted everything to be perfect before moving on.  

For HTML Validate I used [The W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/).  
For CSS I used [The W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/).

Testing before deployment:

Index validate

### Bugs ###  

It has been a large number of issues and bugs during the development of this website, the noteworthy below:  
Footer - wouldent stay at the bottom, it was a tiny gap I needed my mentor to help me with. I was missing the class="h-100" in the html, and that combined with the class="footer mt-auto" it was pushed the final bit.
